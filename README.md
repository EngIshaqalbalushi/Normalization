# ðŸ”„ Database Normalization Project

This project demonstrates **Database Normalization** â€” the process of organizing data in a relational database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It includes examples of unnormalized data and step-by-step transformation into First (1NF), Second (2NF), and Third Normal Forms (3NF).

## ðŸ“Œ Key Objectives

- Understand and apply the principles of database normalization
- Transform unnormalized data into normalized forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- Design normalized database schemas
- Improve data integrity and eliminate redundancy
